  <h1 style="color:Blue">\[\textsf{Visualizing WSPDs and their applications}\]</h1>
  <p class="justify"> Introduced by Callahan and Kosaraju back in 1995, the concept of well-separated pair decomposition
    (\(\textsf{WSPD}\))
    has occupied a special significance in computational geometry when it comes to solving distance problems in
    \(d\)-space.
    We present an in-browser tool that can be used to visualize \(\textsf{WSPD}\)s and several of their applications in
    \(2\)-space.
    Apart from research, it can also be used by instructors for introducing \(\textsf{WSPD}\)s in a classroom setting.
    <BR>
    <BR>

    \(\textbf{Definition.}\) Let \(P\) and \(Q\) be two finite pointsets in \(d\)-space and \(s\) be a positive real
    number.
    We say that \(P\) and \(Q\) are \(\textbf{well-separated}\) with respect to \(s\),
    if there exist two congruent disjoint balls \(B_P\) and \(B_Q\), such that \(B_P\) contains the
    bounding-box of \(P\), \(B_Q\) contains the bounding-box of \(Q\), and the distance between \(B_P\) and \(B_Q\)
    is at least \(s\) times the common radius of \(B_P\) and \(B_Q\). The quantity \(s\) is referred to as the
    \(\textbf{separation ratio}\)
    of the decomposition. Using this idea of well-separability, one can define a well-separated decomposition
    (\(\textsf{WSPD}\))
    of a pointset in the following way.

    <BR>
    <BR>

    Let \(P\) be a set of \(n\) points in \(d\)-space and \(s\) be a positive real number.
    A \(\textbf{well-separated decomposition}\) for \(P\) with respect to \(s\) is a collection of pairs of
    non-empty subsets of \(P\), \(\{A_1,B_1\},\{A_2,B_2\},\ldots,\{A_m,B_m\}\) for some integer \(m\)
    (referred to as the size of the \(\textsf{WSPD}\)) such that
  <ul>
    <li> for each \(i\) with \(1 \leq i \leq m\), \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) are well-separated with respect to \(s\), and
    </li>
    <li> for any two distinct points \(p,q \in P\), there is exactly one index \(i\) with \(1 \leq i \leq m\),
      such that \(p \in A_i, q \in B_i\), or \(p \in B_i, q \in A_i\).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:Maroon" id="algorithms">\[\textsf{Algorithms implemented}\]</h2>

  <p class="borderexample">We have implemented the following algorithms. For their pseudocodes, refer to the book on
    geometric spanners by Smid
    and Narasimhan (2007) and our paper that appeared in the proceedings of SoCG 2022 Multimedia.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>\(\textsf{ConstructWSPD}\). This algorithm can construct a \(\textsf{WSPD}\) on a given pointset when the
      separation ratio \(s\) is passed to it.
      Construction is done using a split tree which is constructed prior to the generation of the
      \(\textsf{WSPD}\) pairs.
    </li>
    <li>\(t\textsf{-Spanner}\). Given a pointset \(P\) and \(t\geq 1\), a \(t\)-spanner on \(P\) is a Euclidean
      geometric graph
      \(G\) on \(P\) such that for every pair of points \(p,q \in P\),
      the length of the shortest-path between \(p,q\) in \(G\) is at most
      \(t\) times the Euclidean distance between them.
      This algorithm can construct a \(t\)-spanner on a pointset using a \(\textsf{WSPD}\) when a value \(>1\) is
      supplied for the parameter \(t\). </li>
    <li>\(\textsf{Closest Pair}\). The problem asks to find two distinct points of \(P\) whose distance is minimum among
      the \(C(n,2)\) point pairs.
      A \(2\)-spanner is needed to compute the closest pair. So, the spanner is constructed first and then the desired
      closest pair is computed.
    </li>
    <li>\(k-\textsf{Closest Pairs}\). It is a generalization of the closest-pair problem. Given a positive integer \(k\)
      such that \(k \leq C(n,2)\), the goal is to find the \(k\) closest pairs among the \(C(n,2)\) pairs. This
      algorithm accepts
      two parameters: \(k\) and \(s>0\). The parameter \(s\) is used to construct a \(\textsf{WSPD}\) which is the
      starting point of this algorithm.</li>
    <li>
      \(\textsf{All Nearest Neighbors (ANN).}\) In this problem, for every point \(p \in P\), we need to find
      its nearest neighbor \(q \in P\setminus \{p\} \). The algorithm starts off by constructing a \(\textsf{WSPD}\)
      with separation ratio
      \(s>2\).
    </li>
    <li>
      \(t-\textsf{Approximate MST.}\) Let \(t>1\), be a real number. A tree connecting the points of \(P\) is called
      a \(t\)-approximate minimum spanning tree of \(P\),
      if its weight is at most \(t\) times the weight of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of \(P\).
      The algorithm accepts a value for \(t\).
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2 style="color:Maroon" id="directions">\[\textsf{Using this tool}\]</h2>

  <p>There are primarily two steps for using this tool, (i) entering the points, (ii) selecting an algorithm. </p>

  <h3 style="color:Green" id="pointDirections">\(\textsf{(i) Entering and deleting points}\)</h3>

  <p class="borderexample">
    The tool supports three ways to enter points onto the canvas. The user can use a combination of these three to
    create a point set for experiments. Among these, the easiest is to just click on the canvas. In this case, the
    points
    will be plotted automatically.
    The second way is to manually enter the points inside the text-box and hit <b>\(\textsf{Plot points}\)</b>. The
    third way is to use
    randomly generated point sets. If the desired cardinality of a point set is entered in the textbox above the
    <b>\(\textsf{Generate}\)</b> button,
    the tool can quickly generate a point set and plot the points on the canvas when the <b>\(\textsf{Generate}\)</b>
    button is hit. We have
    supplied a few built-in pointsets for experiments which can be easily selected using the drop-down menu.
  </p>

  <p class="borderexample">Deletion of a point can be easily done just by right-clicking on the point. </p>

  <p class="borderexample">Every point is automatically given an integer ID for easy reference on the board. However,
    the user can turn off this
    feature by unchecking the <b>\(\textsf{Show point IDs}\)</b> checkbox.</p>

  <h3 style="color:Green" id="algorithmDirections">\(\textsf{(ii) Selecting an algorithm}\)</h3>

  <p class="borderexample"> Once the desired point set is entered and finalized, the user can choose an algorithm
    for visualization. The slider bar can be used to control the animation speed. Algorithm tracing can be turned
    off using the \(\textsf{Highlight pseudocode steps}\) checkbox to increase animation speed. If the user is not
    interested to see the \(\textsf{WSPD}\) construction
    steps, it can be easily turned off using the \(\textsf{Animate WSPD steps}\) checkbox provided. </p>


  <h3 style="color:Green" id="screenShotDirections">\(\textsf{(iii) Exporting the board as PNG/SVG}\)</h3>

  <p class="borderexample">The tool allows users to export an image of the board (not necessarily with the spanner) in
    PNG and SVG formats. To capture an image, simply click either on the <b>\(\textsf{PNG}\)</b>
    or on the <b>\(\textsf{SVG}\)</b> button.
