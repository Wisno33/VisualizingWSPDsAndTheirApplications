# Visualizing WSPDs And Their Applications, SoCG 2022 Multimedia

Introduced by Callahan and Kosaraju back in 1995, the concept of well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD) has occupied a special significance in computational geometry when it comes to solving distance problems in d-space. We present an in-browser tool that can be used to visualize WSPDs and several of their applications in 2-space. Apart from research, it can also be used by instructors for introducing WSPDs in a classroom setting. The tool will be permanently maintained by the third author at his GitHub.
